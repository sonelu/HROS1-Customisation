Head Tilt Customisation
===============

Improves the tilt capability.

Updated parts:
- Tilt Plate Bracket: has longer supports
- Tilt Servo Bracket: has a reduced diameter (equal to the Tilt Plate Bracket) in order to allow more tilt before they hit the top of the pan servo
- Tilt Swing Arms: have been extended by 10mm to account for the longer supports in the Tilt Plate Bracket and to improve the forward tilt

The mounting differences (see the picture):
- Tilt Swing Arms are on the exterior; they no longer hit the pan servo bracket
- In order to mount the Tilt Swing Arms on the exterior there are 2 spacers also provided, one 10mm (on the left side) and one 7mm (on the right side)
- The cross-bar has been moved and the screws that hold the Tilt Cam and the Tilt Arm are now screwed into the cross-bar; this removes completely any knocking between the cross-bar and the tilt servo

There is a small error introduced by the fact that the Tilt Swing Arms are longer, so when the tilt servo is at 512 position the head is not perfectly horizontal, but slightly facing down. The offset for this servo will have to be adjusted.

With this setup the range the Tilt servo can support is 260 (down -75ยบ) to 730 (up 63ยบ).
