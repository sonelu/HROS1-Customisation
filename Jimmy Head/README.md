Custom Jimmy-themed head for HR-OS1
===============

These is a head customisation for HR-OS1 based on the Jimmy humanoid robot (http://www.21stcenturyrobot.com).

The characteristics of the customisation:
- head pan servo (#19) moved in the torso between the two shoulder servos; this requires a customised P1 plate that also includes a "collar" that helps protecting the horn of the servo
- a custom Neck that houses the tilt servo (#20); this also doubles as a cable channel between pan servo and tilt servo
- we use an additional cable from the tilt servo (#20) into the head to power the electronics in the head (Raspberry Pi or ODROID-XU4)
- the head is made of two parts (bottom and top) to simplify the assembly
- the bottom part is assembled to the tilt servo by using two L shaped brackets (head joint)
- the top part of the head has holes for 2 cameras, support for 2 40mm speakers and 2 microphones (from the cameras) as well as support for a Raspberry Pi or ODROID-XU4
- the two speakers are fixed in position with 2 speaker Caps

Some of the fixing uses heat serts (M2 and M3). I strongly recommend you to get hold of some these bad bous if you're really into 3D printing.

The cameras that is use are: Vantage WebCam 300 (http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B004VJ322E)

The speakers are 40mm x 5mm and are rated 3W at 4ohm.

I have included FreeCad files (in case you want to modify them) as well as STEP and STL exports.

Assembly instruction to follow shortly.
